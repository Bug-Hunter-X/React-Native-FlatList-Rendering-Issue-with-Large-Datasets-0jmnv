This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue manifests as the list failing to render correctly, sometimes showing blank spaces or only rendering a portion of the data. This is often due to inefficient rendering or improper handling of the data source.  Here's an example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset} // largeDataset is a very large array
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
/>
```
