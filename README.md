# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with extensive datasets. The list fails to render correctly, often displaying blank spaces or only a subset of the data. The solution focuses on optimizing rendering by using techniques like windowing and virtualization.

## Bug Description

The core problem involves rendering a large number of items within the `FlatList`.  Inefficient rendering or issues with key extraction can cause performance bottlenecks, leading to incomplete or incorrect rendering.

## Solution

The solution addresses this issue by incorporating virtualization techniques to improve the rendering efficiency. This involves rendering only visible items, significantly reducing the load on the UI thread.  The solution also provides a more robust key extraction method.
